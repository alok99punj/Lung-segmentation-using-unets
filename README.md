# Lung-segmentation-using-unets


Abstract:

Lung segmentation is often considered to be a critical task in radiography and medical-imaging analysis as it enables the measurement of lung volumes and the detection of abnormalities such as fluid buildup, inflammation in the lung tissues, tumours and nodules. This paper proposes a method for lung segmentation based on a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) called U-Net which is designed for biomedical image segmentation. The proposed method combines the U-Net architecture with Dilated Convolutions and Bi-linear Interpola- tion to improve the performance and robustness of the model. The proposed methodology has been trained and tested on a pub- licly available dataset, outperforming existing lung segmentation methods with respect to both Dice and Intersection Over Union Scores. The obtained results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed U-Net-based approach for lung segmentation.
